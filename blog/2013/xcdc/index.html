<p>It has been quite some time since I participated in a competition (2010 was the last time @ <a href="/blog/2010/daq/">FSG</a>). I had been waiting for the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/xcdc2013/home" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">XCDC2013</a> and what an amazing experience it was!!!</p>

<p>I learn’t a lot and thoroughly enjoyed the team work. It was like a symphony. Spending hours with my team mates Bharat and Roshan, sprouting new approaches and bouncing ideas off each other. I can never forget that moment when at 2am in the Hunt library we managed to Overclock the Snapdragon S3 (APQ8060) on the <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/mobile-development/development-devices/snapdragon-mdp-legacy-devices" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MSM8660</a> (Dragonboard) and there were high fives all around. In this blog post I will try to cover everything what we did/tried for this event. (The <a href="#appendix">Appendix section</a> has all the detailed procedures)</p>

<p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Optimize the Page load speed of a web browser on the platform previously mentioned. We had to improve both performance and energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Before we begin the optimizations/changes we need to know how to measure the performance and energy efficiency. So, we decided to rely on the following tools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Browser benchmarks:</strong> Use the benchmarks mentioned <a href="http://wikis.lib.ncsu.edu/index.php/XCDC_Android_Development#Browser_Benchmarks" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a> to check page load times for your browser. Okay now go use <a href="http://www.webkit.org/perf/sunspider-0.9.1/sunspider-0.9.1/driver.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this link</a> to see which out of Chrome, IE and Firefox is fastest on your PC… No seriously, try it out.</li>
  <li>
<strong>DDMS/Traceview:</strong> Dalvik Debug Monitor Server (DDMS) is accessible via Eclipse and is present in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ADT bundle</a> tools section. It can be used to generate trace logs for applications/processes running on the target device. Use this to determine the costliest sections of the application.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Perf:</strong> The <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Tutorial" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">perf</a> tool can be used for recording process activity information. Most of the frequently invoked code is written in native C. This is where perf comes in. The names of functions in perf reports are generated by JNI and they can be correlated with the corresponding “.so” (shared object files) shown in perf report. You can look for these functions in the source code for modifications. Additionally, you may check the hardware counters using perf (if enabled).</li>
  <li>
<strong>Trepn Profiler:</strong> This tool has been designed by Qualcomm to measure effects of an application on the mobile device’s power, data and CPU. The MDP (Mobile development platform) has embedded sensors which are used by <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/mobile-development/development-devices/trepn-profiler" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">trepn</a> to gather the required information and it allows saving all gathered data to a csv file.</li>
  <li>
<strong>AnTuTu Benchmark:</strong> The AnTuTu benchmark is an android app which gauges performance based on different tests. Though this does not measure browser performance, it is useful to determine general purpose performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The MDP came with a stock gingerbread image. We ran the stock Android browser through the <a href="#perf-based-profiling">Profiling procedure</a> and collected data. Next we <a href="#flash-ics-stock-image-provided-by-bsquare-using-windows7">flashed Ice cream sandwich</a> on the MDP so that we can work on the Browser in the latest Android flavor compatible with the MDP. Then we profiled again to collect baseline data on ICS. Just upgrading to ICS gave a speedup of around 2 (compared to gingerbread baseline). We <a href="#compiling-ics-from-source">pulled the ICS source and compiled it</a> ( had some snacks, took a break, fixed some errors…this part over and over again) on 32-bit Ubuntu 12.04  and a MAC OSX 10.8.3.</p>

<p>Now came the interesting part OPTIMIZATIONS!!!</p>

<p>A look at the Sunspider trace collected from DDMS showed that the browser package is nowhere near the costliest sections. The major chunk of time is spent in Timer handling code which belongs to the Webcore package. Time to do a grep in the Kernel source. The outcome: we located frameworks/base/core/java/android/webkit/JWebCoreJavaBridge.java (Note that for all paths hereon we are in the ICS source directory that was pulled) where the method code was present. Then Surpiiissseee, the file is a bridge which provides interface for functions implemented in native C. Okay so now to look for the C code and we ended up at external/webkit/Source/WebKit/android/jni/JavaBridge.cpp . The code is small, the underlying functions are small and offer no avenues for the optimizations we had in mind (removing dependencies, vectorizing code for the Neon SIMD unit). Back to hunting for places to optimize. Next we found the code responsible for triggering shared timers. We reduced the max duration of firing timers at external/webkit/Source/WebCore/platform/ThreadTimers.cpp  in the webkit code. This just slowed the benchmarks down and we later figured out that this timer changes the interval at which next computation will be processed by Webkit <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~burg/projects/timelapse/articles/webkit-event-implementation/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(details here)</a>.</p>

<p>At this point we were going nowhere and just jumping from one function to another to find a small piece of code in every one of them. That’s when Bharat said let’s do kernel modifications. But where would we start? He proposed using a kernel module to overclock the processor <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1158951" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(refer this link)</a>. <a href="#permitting-apps-to-use-root">(Here is how we set up the needed apps)</a>. Well it was a new approach, we thought it’s worth a shot and began compiling the KMOD <a href="#makefile-to-compile-kmod-for-android-ics-source">(makefile here)</a>. Locating the kernel source directory and fixing the makefile was another challenge. We pulled Linux kernel and used that directory as source but it asked for configurations. Then we tried default configurations using “make menuconfig” and “make oldconfig”. No luck. A modinfo showed inconsistency in the vermagic. Finally found the exact source directory and did insmod successfully. The MDP rebooted! Tried another set of configurations another reboot and no messages using dmesg or logcat. Finally found kernel messages by doing “cat /proc/kmsg”. The module simply looked for for the voltage setting and replaced any entry in memory that matched the unsigned long value 1250000 with an appropriately different value. There was a illegal memory access which causes the Kernel oops, so we moved the start address for the lookup. Luckily the module got inserted for 1.5GHz setting (max frequency previously was 1.2GHz) and we ran the benchmark. We expected a speedup but instead the performance dropped by half. Maybe there was a mismatch in the L2, RAM and CPU frequency or the module replaced values in some other locations as well which had adverse affects on the system.</p>

<p>Down but not out, we decided to look into the kernel source to find matching functions and located the tables responsible for the clock setup and PLL (kernel/arch/arm/mach-msm/acpuclock-8×60.c). Bingo, went through the code, added entries, compiled and flashed. Checked the MDP. Yes! the changes reflected. Ran the benchmarks. Did it work? See for yourself:</p>

<p>We presented out results and bagged the 3rd spot at the competition. Why not 1st? Well we overclocked the MDP, but then that reduces battery life. The scheduler and high-low frequencies at kernel level have been designed to give the best experience both in terms of performance and energy consumption. So, if we had concentrated more on the browser source (Chrome or <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Fennec</a>; we did compile source for Fennec which took about 7 hours on my system) maybe the results would have been different. Well, in that case we wouldn’t have overclocked the system right? In short what we did was definitely worth it!</p>

<p>With that ended our attempt at XCDC 2013 !!!</p>

<p>Profiling sunspider with DDMS/traceview will show major chunk on time being spent in sharedTimerFired which belongs in webkit package. The WebKit Java Bridge is in frameworks/base/core/java/android/webkit/Jwebcorejavabridge and in external/webkit/Source/WebKit/android/jni/JavaBridge.cpp. Changes to the timers are in external/webkit/Source/WebCore/platform/ThreadTimers.cpp.</p>

<p>The libraries, once compiled, will be found in out/target/product/msm8660_surf/system/lib. The perf tool showed major time being used by libv8.so and libwebcore.so. But a “ls -la” in the above directory shows libwebcore.so being updated after making changes to shared timer code. Hence push this file to /system/lib and also push the app Browser.apk</p>

<p>Follow all of the steps mentioned <a href="http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. Specifically the ones under Branch 4.0.x and previous since you will be compiling ICS.</p>

<p>Also follow the steps given at <a href="http://www.spencerpages.com/wiki/index.php?title=Dragonboard_8060_Development#Recreating_the_Ice_Cream_Sandwich_Source" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Spencerpages</a> (do not use the fixes mentioned for errors in case you are on MAC)</p>

<p>We managed to compile the ICS source on two different platforms, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (32-bit) and Mac OS X (10.8.3).</p>

<p>Changes specific to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (32-bit) are as follows:
After the Step 8 mentioned in “ Recreating the Ice Cream Sandwich” section in spencer pages, you might encounter the following errors:</p>

<h4 id="compile-android-ics-on-mac-os-x-1083">Compile Android ICS on Mac OS X (10.8.3)</h4>

<p>The changes specific to compiling on OS X and those not presented in the two links at the top are mentioned here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Grab the Mac OS X 10.5 SDK.
Most of the tools that are required will be installed when you grab the latest version of Xcode that is available. Also, do install the “Command Line Tools” from within Xcode.
For the 10.5 SDK, you need to register as an Apple Developer and Download an older version of Xcode that has the 10.5 SDK.
To add the SDK, I re-installed the MacOSX10.5.pkg from the Xcode 3.2.6 download. It is in a hidden folder named “Packages” on the disk image. After mounting the .dmg file, you can open it from the command line with open /Volumes/Xcode\ and\ iOS\ SDK/Packages/. When installing the package, choose change install location and option-click on the drive you want to install to, so that you can specify a folder. The target folder should be /Developer or the base of your Xcode 4 install if you have put it in a non-standard location.</li>
  <li>Get the “real” gcc.
You’ll get a llvm version of gcc with the Xcode Command Line tools install. But that doesn’t seem to like Cross Compilation too much. So, I would suggest get a gcc through macports and make it your default. I used gcc 4.7.</li>
  <li>Errors and their specific fixes:<br>
