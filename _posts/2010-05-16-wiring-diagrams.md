In the year 2010, I was the electronics team captain for [Orion Racing India](http://www.orion-racing.com/) (A student team which designs a formula style race car to compete in an international design competition: [Formula Student Germany](http://www.formulastudent.de/)). Among the many responsibilities which came with being an electronics team member (apart from fixing the lighting and fans in the workshop), a very basic yet extremely important was laying the wiring for the car. Me and my teammates: Nikhil, Nathanael, Hemen, Gaurang and Anup initially tried to look for some software for making the wiring diagrams. However, a pen and a paper proved to be the best tools.

I am sharing below the final wiring diagrams and block descriptions for the [ORI2010](http://www.orion-racing.com/ori-2010/). Before arriving at the final layout, we had to go through multiple revisions. At each stage of the revision we were able to reduce/re-route many wires. Additionally, wiring diagrams helped us in quick troubleshooting and hassle free insertion/removal of sensors/modules.

You may find many acronyms being used in the component placement as well as the wiring layouts. Their descriptions are provided in the images that follow. (Open images in a new tab for better resolution)

Tie wires proved to be quite useful when we were laying the wiring. One could easily unwind them and add/remove wires. Once the layout on the car was complete, we replaced the tie wires with [cable ties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_tie).
