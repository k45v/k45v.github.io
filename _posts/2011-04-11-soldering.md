Pointers to keep in mind while soldering:  

1. Set temperature to 320°C (608°F). (if you have some experience, else bring it down to about 270°C)

1. After real temperature reaches the set temperature, use a damp sponge to
clean the tip and check for damages. The sponge also helps in thermally shocking the iron, i.e. forces the iron into maximum heat cycle.

1. If you have brass wool or metal brushes on your solder stand then use them for cleaning instead of the sponge, since tiny blobs of solder might get trapped in the sponge and start accumulating at the bottom.

1. If the tip has oxidation, apply solder and wipe using the damp sponge, repeat these steps until oxidation is removed.

1. Apply some soldering flux to get better finish (also useful when desoldering)

1. After cleaning, coat tip with a layer of solder and set it aside ready for the
next usage. You may leave a lump of solder on the tip, this helps the tip last much longer.

1. If the tip shows dis-figuration or has rust on it. Change the tip.  

1. **Tinning:** Tin wire NOT till the insulation but till 1.6mm before insulation as bending might cause breakage of insulation!!!

1. Take care so as not to damage the meniscus of ceramic/button capacitors.

1. Use wood/toothpick to hold down wires in board repair

1. Always check your work using a magnifying glass (Better safe than sorry).
