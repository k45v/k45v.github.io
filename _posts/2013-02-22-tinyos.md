Recently I got my hands on the TelosB mote and as the tradition goes, I had to test blinking LEDs on it. (If you want to compare this mote with few others out there then this is a [good paper to refer](http://www.vsrdjournals.com/EEC/Issue/2012_02_Feb/Web/3_Vini_Madan_582_Review_Article_Feb_2012.pdf)).

Initially, I went to the TinyOS [getting started](http://docs.tinyos.net/tinywiki/index.php/Getting_started) page which provides instructions for [installing TinyOS 2.1.1](http://docs.tinyos.net/tinywiki/index.php/Installing_TinyOS_2.1.1#Two-step_install_on_your_host_OS_with_Debian_packages). It had few steps missing and one can run “tos-check-env” and google for the errors which show up. However, when I went on to make the blinking LED project (make telosb), it spewed out a host of errors similar to this line “/opt/tinyos-2.1.1/tos/platforms/telosa/PlatformLedsC.nc:54: cannot find `Port56′”. Apparently the msp430 packages did not jive with this TinyOS version 2.1.1 and multiple posts online suggested rolling back to legacy versions.

I decided to give TinyOS 2.1.2 a shot and it worked!!! So well here is the entire procedure for you:

1. Remove brltty package to avoid FTDI to serial conflicts
```shell
sudo apt-get autoremove brltty
```
Make sure you have the build-essentials package
```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```
1. Execute the following command,
```shell
sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list
```
Hit “G” to go to end of file and then hit “A”. Paste the line given below at the end of this file
```shell
add deb http://tinyos.stanford.edu/tinyos/dists/ubuntu lucid main
```
In case you had previous repositories for TinyOS in source, then remove them.
Hit ESC, then enter “:wq” to save and quit

1. Now install TinyOS 2.1.2 using
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tinyos-2.1.2
```
1. Now you need to configure the environment for TinyOS. Do
```shell
sudo vi ~/.bashrc
```
Add the lines given below at the end of this file
```shell
# Sourcing the tinyos environment variable setup script
source /opt/tinyos-2.1.2/tinyos.sh
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:.
```
Create the setup script using:
```shell
sudo vi /opt/tinyos-2.1.2/tinyos.sh
```
Now enter the following contents into this file (use “i” to insert, ctrl+shift+v to paste)
   ```shell
   #! /usr/bin/env bash
   # Here we setup the environment
   # variables needed by the tinyos 
   # make system
   
   # echo "Setting up for TinyOS 2.1.2"
   export TOSROOT=
   export TOSDIR=
   export MAKERULES=
   
   TOSROOT="/opt/tinyos-2.1.2"
   TOSDIR="$TOSROOT/tos"
   CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$TOSROOT/support/sdk/java:$TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar
   MAKERULES="$TOSROOT/support/make/Makerules"
   
   export TOSROOT
   export TOSDIR
   export CLASSPATH
   export MAKERULES
   ```
Run the command below to allow this script to execute
```shell
sudo chmod 755 /opt/tinyos-2.1.2/tinyos.sh
```
1. Now close and start a new terminal or alternatively
```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```
1. Run the command
```shell
tos-check-env
```
If it gives warnings related to Java version then do
```shell
java -version
```
If your version is above 1.5, then ignore this warning else upgrade to a newer java version. Ignore the warning related to graphviz.

1. Now insert Telos mote in your USB slot. You may run the command
```shell
motelist
```
to check if it was detected. The output will be
```shell
$motelist
Reference  Device           Description
---------- ---------------- ---------------------------------------------
M49WC0OT   /dev/ttyUSB0     Moteiv tmote sky
```
Allow writing to the USB port using (substitute your device name as per the previous output)
```shell
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0
```
Navigate to the blinking led project folder
```shell
sudo bash
cd /opt/tinyos-2.1.2/apps/Blink
```
Execute the command below and the code should get compiled
```shell
make telosb
```
Install the blinking LED application on the mote using
```shell
make telosb reinstall
```
The command above assumes you have only one Telos mote on USB. Else use the command
```shell
make telosb reinstall bsl,/dev/ttyUSB0
```
You should see the LEDs come to life.
