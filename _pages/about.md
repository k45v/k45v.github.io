I am an engineering leader who enjoys doing meaningful work alongside smart people.

* Currently, I am a Security Engineering Manager at Google, where I am focused on making a step-function improvement in defensive security along the software/hardware boundary.
* Prior to this, I was a Staff Software Engineer at Facebook, where I explored the AR/VR landscape.
* I also led multiple efforts at Apple, working across all aspects of the heterogeneous (monolithic/microkernel) operating system software stack, touching the entire Apple product lineup over [multiple SoC generations](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/1/web/1). Some of my work improved [device update flows](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-software-updates-secf683e0b36/1/web/1), some introduced novel hardware to deter physical attacks, and some helped provision secret keys, but all of it [raised the bar](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/volume-encryption-with-filevault-sec4c6dc1b6e/1/web/1) on device security.
* In the avionics space, I worked with a smaller group handling pretty much everything from circuit design, to soldering, to firmware, for an autopilot system of a small fixed-wing aircraft.
* I also had a fun run as a Formula SAE electronics team captain, doing everything I did above for avionics, but this time in the [automotive space]({% post_url 2010-07-30-daq %}).

You can find some of my writings in the [blog section](/blog/index.html), and [my CV](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf) has more details on my experience and work history.

I maintain a bucket list and enjoy checking items off of it. I've run two half-marathons pre-COVID and would like to do more of those.
